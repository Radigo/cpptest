# How to build and run on Windows
The goal is to have a lightweight working SDL2 dev environment under windows. It will use g++ builder and the ucrt64 flavor of SDL. They both are available in the msys2 tool chain and can be easily install with minimal effort.
## Required:
- msys64 [https://www.msys2.org/]
- VScode [https://code.visualstudio.com/]
## Procedure
1. install msys2 (I use the default location from here) and launch msys64.exe
2. use pacman to get the required build tools and SDL

> pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain

> pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-SDL2

3. install VScode
4. install c/c++ extension pack
## Usage
- c_cpp_properties.json (generated by c/c++ extension)

Add to include path:
> "C:/msys64/ucrt64/include/"

Set "compilerPath":
> "C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin/g++.exe"

- tasks.json (generated after trying to build with VScode)

Set "command":
> "C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin/g++.exe"

Add after -o in "args":
>"-LC:/msys64/lib"

> "-lSDL2"

> "-lSDL2main"

- launch.json (generated after first "run & debug (ctrl+shift+D)")

Set "miDebuggerPath":
> "C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin/gdb.exe"
